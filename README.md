# GTA-Air
Bored of playing games using joystick? Using 'Air' controller provides us a new handle to play any computer game, just move your hands 
(in air!!) over the 'Air'controller and it will control the vehicle in the appropriately (something like gesture recognition). The 
components required were: an Arduino Leonardo, 4 Ir-sensors and some waste cardboard boxes. In this video we use 'Air'-controller to 
control a car in GTA vice city game.
